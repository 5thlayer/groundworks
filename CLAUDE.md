## Releases

A change a Consumer can use or will notice adds its line under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` as it lands. Before bumping `mod_version`, publishing to `~/.m2` or tagging a release, read `docs/agents/releases.md`: releases go through `scripts/release.sh`, and a published version never changes.

A release that must reach Beltworks or the Pack follows the `release-train` skill: one owning session per checkout, releases in order Groundworks → Beltworks → Pack, and pushes only on the user's word.

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues, managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, used verbatim as label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
